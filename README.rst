===========================================================
 Justifiably paranoid Ansible deployment of OpenSSH-server
===========================================================

* Only use ed25519 keys with elliptic-curve Diffieâ€“Hellman for key exchange

* Only use the new transport cipher! `chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com`

* Operators are advised to use bcrypt KDF to protect keys at rest
